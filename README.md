"TempName" is a fork from [LeagueToolkit](https://github.com/4dams/LeagueToolkit), different from the original project this application is a set of useful scripts like an auto queue accept, an automatic chat message whenever you press a configured button, changes the lol language or show your mastery emote whenever you use the zed ultimate for example.

If you want to know more about this process and how it works exactly, please check out [this post on the Riot Games Engineering Blog](https://engineering.riotgames.com/news/architecture-league-client-update)!

## The Reason Behind It

Goal of this application is to show the process of how the LCU handles a player's data and how it is possible to interfere this process.

## Design

![Preview](https://github.com/4dams/LeagueToolkit/blob/master/LeagueToolkit/images/previews/1.png)

For the design of the app, we wanted to stick to the clean and flawless design of the LCU, as you can see on the [preview page](https://github.com/4dams/LeagueToolkit/wiki/Previews) of this repository or simply in the app itself.
